## Overview

### The challenge

A landing page design has been given. We have to implement it in such a way so that users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React


### What I learned

From this project, I learned a lot about SVGs and how to position them as background images. It was really tricky but I made it at last! I also learned about how to set CSS styles from within a JavaScript file in a React project and how to use media queries from the JavaScript file using a package called [react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive).
